# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the full project, along with a backend running locally, please follow these steps:

Please ensure you have Node installed on your computer beforehand. Open the repository in your editor and open a new terminal. Then execute these commands one by one:

>> cd backend (Navigates to the backend folder)
>> npm install (Installs all necessary dependencies, this may take a few minutes.)
>> npm start (Starts the backend server)

Once you see the success messages of "Server running" and "MongoDB connected", you can open the deployed frontend url provided in the report and use the app normally. Use the username "username" and password "password". Ensure you keep the backend server running otherwise the app will not function. Please email if oyu have any issues:
